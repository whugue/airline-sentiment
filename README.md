#### Airline Brand Sentiment Dashboard

The Airline Brand Sentiment Dashboard (snappier title pending - suggestion welcome) allows U.S. airlines to monitor Twitter sentiment towards their brand in real time and benchmark social media performance against competitors.

Development of this app is still in progress, but you can check out some of the model training I've done so far [here](https://github.com/whugue/airline-sentiment/tree/master/model/training)

You can also check out an exploratory analysis I completed at Metis, comparing the performance of machine learning vs. rule-based sentiment analyzers, [here](https://github.com/whugue/airline-sentiment/tree/master/exploratory)
